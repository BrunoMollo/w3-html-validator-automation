# W3 HTML Validator automation


This uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-after-each) to scrape 
the [w3 html validator](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-after-each) to easily test all the views of a web application.

By runing this you will get:
- A list of all the routes that have errors
- A screenshoot of each validation result
